    **I am ==icon:sign-simple Andrea Marín==, ring piercer and owner of Saudace Piercing.

    I am 27 years old and I dedicate myself to body piercing professionally since 2017, although my interests and concerns for this profession arose long before, when I began to pierce sporadically to acquaintances with 15 years old, until 2017, which was when I fully immersed myself in this profession and discovered that body piercing is my passion and an imprescincible part of my life.

    I have worked in numerous studios inside and outside Spain and, I could say, that the piercings that I like to perform the most are septums, daiths and microdermals due to the complexity of these.

    I also like a lot to perform anatomical studies and see what compositions could fit you better. 

    I am part of the association [CEP (Comunidad Española de Perforadores)](https://ceperforadores.org/) as a member and I regularly attend seminars to be updated.

    I opened the doors of my own place on December 17, 2024, because after a nomadic working life, I wanted to settle back in my city and give this profession the space it deserves.

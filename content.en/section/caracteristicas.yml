    title: Safe Piercings
    subtitle: And with the best materials
    md: |
      Saudace piercing is a studio created to give the place it deserves to the body piercing in our city, where the necessary standards are applied to perform a piercing safely.

      All our facilities create a circuit that minimizes the risks of cross-contamination, which makes the space safe for everyone.

      My working praxis is based on using a set of techniques that lead to a safe piercing, such as the aseptic technique with an American needle. In addition, I only and exclusively work with biocompatible jewelry.

      The piercing is an ancient technique and must be treated with great respect, if it is not done by a professional it can have irreversible consequences.

      If you do not know what would be the best choice for you, you can contact me, and I will advise you until you reach the best option.

      I remind you that not all anatomies are suitable for all piercings but we can always find a viable and beautiful solution for you.

      You can also get inspired by the works you will find on this page.

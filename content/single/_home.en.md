    subtitle: And with the best materials
    md: |
      Saudace piercing is a studio created to give the place it deserves to the body piercing in our city, where the necessary standards are applied to perform a piercing safely.

      All our facilities create a circuit that minimizes the risks of cross-contamination, which makes the space safe for everyone.

      My working praxis is based on using a set of techniques that lead to a safe piercing, such as the aseptic technique with an American needle. In addition, I only and exclusively work with biocompatible jewelry.

      [[:sparkles: See Praxis]](#praxis)
  consulting:
    title: Advice
    subtitle: I will be happy to guide you
    md: |
      The piercing is an ancient technique and must be treated with great respect, if it is not done by a professional it can have irreversible consequences.

      If you do not know what would be the best choice for you, you can contact me, and I will advise you until you reach the best option.

      I remind you that not all anatomies are suitable for all piercings but we can always find a viable and beautiful solution for you.

      You can also get inspired by the works you will find on this page.

      Which will ensure your healing. I use materials such as ASTMF136 certified implant grade titanium, 14k and 18k gold, niobium and borosilicate glass.

      I have jewelry in stock to suit all tastes. From settings, cyconias, opals or opal stone (natural stones) of all colors and different shapes.

      My work does not end when I make your piercing, but we will do a **follow up** and I will be available for you, until your piercing is completely healthy.

      Here are some tips to take care of your new piercing.

      title: Aseptic Technique
      md: |
        All the material I use is previously sterilized, following a set of measures that can be performed separately or combined, depending on the clinical procedure, and that must be fulfilled to maintain sterility during the drilling process, guaranteeing biosafety.

      title: American Needle
      md: |
        I use only American Needle. This special needle for body piercing, allows a faster and cleaner piercing, which translates into less pain, less inflammation and faster healing process.
    - icon: gem
      title: Biocompatible Jewelry
      md: |
        I only work with biocompatible materials such as titanium, gold, niobium and borosilicate glass to minimize the risk of rejection and ensure healing. Biocompatible materials are those that are compatible with the body.

      title: After my New Piercing
      md: |
        Once the appointment is over I will give you some simple tips on how to perform the healing of your new piercing and we will make some appointments to follow up on the piercing.

        We will do the well known 'Downsize'. This is a must since the length of the jewelry needs to be changed once the swelling has gone down to avoid risks.

        To ensure that you receive a good service and that you do not have to wait, we recommend that you ask for [appointment](#contact), since I work in different studios and my schedule is irregular.

    **I am ==:sign-simple: Andrea Mar√≠n==, ring piercer and owner of Saudace Piercing.**

    I am 27 years old and I dedicate myself to body piercing professionally since 2017, although my interests and concerns for this profession came much earlier, when I started to pierce sporadically to acquaintances with 15 years old, until 2017, which was when I fully emerged in this profession and discovered that body piercing is my passion and an indispensable part of my life‚Ä¶.

      **I am ==:sign-simple: Andrea Mar√≠n==, ring piercer and owner of Saudace Piercing.

      I am 27 years old and I dedicate myself to body piercing professionally since 2017, although my interests and concerns for this profession arose long before, when I began to pierce sporadically to acquaintances with 15 years old, until 2017, which was when I fully immersed myself in this profession and discovered that body piercing is my passion and an imprescincible part of my life.

      I have worked in numerous studios inside and outside Spain and, I could say, that the piercings that I like to perform the most are septums, daiths and microdermals due to the complexity of these.

      I also like a lot to perform anatomical studies and see what compositions could fit you better. 

      I am part of the association [CEP (Comunidad Espa√±ola de Perforadores)](https://ceperforadores.org/) as a member and I regularly attend seminars to be updated.

      I opened the doors of my own place on December 17, 2024, because after a nomadic working life, I wanted to settle back in my city and give this profession the space it deserves.

      Andrea is a first class professional.

      Very nice and careful when doing the piercing.

      She did the nostril super well, informing me at all times of the care and maintenance of the same.

      The customer service is exceptional and the prices are very affordable.

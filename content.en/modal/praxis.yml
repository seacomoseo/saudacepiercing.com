  title: Aseptic Technique
  md: |
    All the material I use is previously sterilized, following a set of measures that can be performed separately or combined, depending on the clinical procedure, and that must be fulfilled to maintain sterility during the drilling process, guaranteeing biosafety.

  title: American Needle
  md: |
    I use only American Needle. This special needle for body piercing, allows a faster and cleaner piercing, which translates into less pain, less inflammation and faster healing process.

  title: Biocompatible Jewelry
  md: |
    I only work with biocompatible materials such as titanium, gold, niobium and borosilicate glass to minimize the risk of rejection and ensure healing. Biocompatible materials are those that are compatible with the body.

  title: After my New Piercing
  md: |
    Once the appointment is over I will give you some simple tips on how to perform the healing of your new piercing and we will make some appointments to follow up on the piercing.

    We will do the well known 'Downsize'. This is a must since the length of the jewelry needs to be changed once the swelling has gone down to avoid risks.

    To ensure that you receive a good service and that you do not have to wait, we recommend that you ask for [appointment](#contact), since I work in different studios and my schedule is irregular.
